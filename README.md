## Hi there!

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub! It's still a work in progress, as I populate my GitHub with some work I've done in the past.

### My Experience
At my previous job (Enterprise Singapore), I extensively used Excel and Tableau, including redesigning a dashboard tracking land applications on Tableau and tracking company metrics.
I also have used Apache Superset and some SQL in my work. 
In previous internships I also used PowerBI to design a dashboard to indicate stock service levels for Reckitt.
*These works will not be found here for commercial and security reasons.

### What you might find here
#### Personal Projects
I am in the midst of uploading some personal projects here. These may be from school assignments, or personal projects. I may also further develop previous pieces of schoolwork.
I have also uploaded some group work - if this is the case, they have been attributed and indicated accordingly.
#### Schoolwork Forks
There are two forks (ECON514 and ECON526). These are forks of public repositories for two Masters Level courses I took at UBC. Some of the forks may contain assignments, however, I may have worked on them on my personal computer locally. In otherwords, work seen in this fork may not be the final product I submitted.
